# Assignment_Checker
Assignment_Checker processes Java assignments. 

This will generate a folder for each zip file assignment, processed accordingly.

The project can be downloaded in whole and run using AssignmentChecker.py.
The checkstyle jar is not included; you will need to download <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/checkstyle/files/checkstyle/">checkstyle-8.0-all.jar</a>
and put it in the same directory as AssignmentChecker.py

# Example Assignments
- A00123456.zip has no checkstyle warnings and no compiler errors
- A00234566.zip fails to complete the checkstyle check due to compile errors
- A00345678.zip has various checkstyle warnings and no compiler errors
